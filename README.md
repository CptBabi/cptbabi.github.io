# Website Technical Requirements Copied From Project Overview

Website content must include:
3 pages minimum including the homepage
The pages’ content must be organized and laid out using content blocks as demonstrated in exercises 7 and 9.
Homepage must include 6 content blocks minimum. Other 2 pages must include 4 blocks minimum.
Website must include:
A google map embed
a video,
a web table
a web form that includes at least 4 types of form controls (inputs).
If the website that you chose to redesign doesn’t include all the written content that you need then you can use ChatGPT to produce your content for paragraphs, photo captions and other small details (make a note of it in your code using a comment <!-- Written by ChatGPT –>). All headings and links are highly functional content so they must be well-written.
Images can be sourced from royalty-free stock image sites such as:
https://pixabay.com
https://stocksnap.io
https://www.pexels.com
https://unsplash.com
The website you create will be publicly available on the web so add the following disclaimer in the footer of your website: “This is a fictional website that was designed and coded as an educational exercise. It is not intended to be seen outside of the class environment. None of the content and images were approved by the business owner.”
Website code must include:
A README file that documents the project plan.
All styles must be coded in one external stylesheet
Comments must be included in the source code to point out features and explain the code.
At least 2 Google font families must be used (you can use as many font variants as you like)
The page layouts must be coded mobile-first and look good on all screen sizes. Fluid units and breakpoints will need to be used.
The navigation must be responsive and show a hamburger icon on mobile.
A max-width must be used for the layout on desktop so that the content is centered and doesn’t stretch across the whole width of the viewport.
CSS transitions must be used.
The code throughout the site must demonstrate a good understanding of flexbox.
All coding best practices must be implemented. HTML must be semantic and clean (images have alt tags). CSS must be easy to read and efficient (plan your CSS naming conventions with respect to the different pages and their content blocks before you start coding).
Testing:
You will need to provide screenshots of all the tests listed below. Fix errors as they occur and retest as appropriate:
Validate your HTML for all pages: https://validator.w3.org
Validate your external stylesheet (by file upload): https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator
Check your homepage is accessible (use your published website’s URL): https://wave.webaim.org  
Check your homepage’s page speed:
https://tools.pingdom.com/ or Lighthouse

We won’t perform cross-browser testing for your website.

Presentation Requirements

Students must present their website as though they are presenting the finished website to the client:

Explain which pages you chose to design and build, why you chose those pages. You could include before and after screenshots.
Part 2: Demonstration
Demo the website in the browser by clicking through the different pages in the website, pointing out the features,
Part 3: Conclusion
Explain what went well during this project, what didn't go so well, and what you would do if you had more time to work on the project.
